        <p> Hi, my name is Alexander Egerev. I live in Pennsylvania, about 30 minutes from Philadelphia.
            Ever since I was a child, I always liked working with computers. When I was 13 years old, I first started coding.
            My favorite programming languages are:
            <ol>
                <li> HTML</li>
                <li> CSS </li>
                <li> Java </li>
                <li> C++</li>
                <li> PHP </li>
            </ol>
            Aside from coding, I like to play chess, travel, and draw. 
            <br>
            I also teach English classes on <a href="https://preply.com/en/tutor/4048617">Preply</a>.
